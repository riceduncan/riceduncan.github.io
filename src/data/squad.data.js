    "bio": "Hey Duncan!! We are so very happy to have joined the Duncan family in the Summer of 2020. It turns out that we have first-hand experience as Owls- we were members of some of those other colleges (waving hands toward the south part of campus) where we fell in love with Rice and (cheezy but true) each other. [Fun fact: O-Week brought us together!] After growing up in Dallas (yes, Cowboys fan), Winston majored in biochemistry and flag football (but also rowed crew, played in a jazz band, and did international service trips). Eden has no hometown (having lived in TX, SC, NC, CA, GA, TX, VA, and TX again) but majored in psychology (and joined half of the organizations on campus). Winston now puts his medical and public health degrees to good use as a family doctor and as the Chair of Health Systems and Population Health Sciences at UH. Eden is a professor of industrial-organizational psychology at Rice, studying and teaching about the ways that diversity and inclusion can be strengthened in the workplace. Our two daughters, Maezie (9) and Margot (4), are also excited to be Duncaroos. Like us, they love sports, baking, making and dancing to music, and Rice.",

    "name": "2nd Floor RAs",
    "bio": "Hello Duncan! We are your RAs living on the 2nd floor but we look forward to getting to know all of you, regardless of where you live this year. We’re both born and raised in Poland, which probably explains our accents and sarcastic sense of humor. Bojan is a tennis coach at Rice and first came to the U.S. to study and play tennis at Texas Tech University. After that, followed by an MBA at Western Michigan University, he moved to Houston and has been working for the Owls for the last 8 years. Maggie (Megi) got her degree in law and public administration back in Poland, but her passion has always lay in construction and design. After arriving in the U.S., she decided to change her career, got a degree in interior design (do not confuse with decorating;) and has been working in the industry ever since. Our daughter Kaia is now a year and a half old and we’re very excited that she’ll get to grow up amongst you. We’ve learned that she is very sociable, enjoys meeting and greeting people and gives out disarming smiles to almost anyone who passes by. This is our 7th and last year as RAs and we can’t be more excited to get to know you over meals, study breaks or simply... whenever. You’ll be sure to see us stroll around Duncan and campus so please say hi and stop for a chat when you see us!",

    "name": "3rd Floor RAs",
    "bio": "We’re Ian and Allison and this will be our first year as RAs at Duncan. Before moving to Houston, we actually attended the same high school in Connecticut. We even went to prom together, and have awkward photos together to prove it. Allison attended Emerson College, went on to teach for Teach for America, and then earned her Masters from Harvard in Education. Ian attended Tufts University and received his MFA from the Creative Writing Program at the University of Houston. Ian currently teaches creative writing and podcasting in the English department at Rice and Allison is a literacy content creator at Khan Academy. When we’re not at work, we love to play basketball and go fishing (Ian), do yoga and cook (Allison), eat way too much (both of us), travel, go to the beach, and hang out with our adventurous 4-year-old, Owen. Owen loves riding his bike, splashing in the Dunctank, and playing not-so-frozen freeze tag in the quad. We live on the third floor and are looking forward to hosting many study breaks for you in the coming years.",

    "name": "RFAs",
    "bio": "We are Mack and Jamil, your Resident Faculty Associates. We are excited to begin our 1 st year as RFAs at Duncan. Our love story started freshman year at Rice. Mack was at Sid and Jamil was at Jones. Our first dance together was at Lovett and our first kiss (ewww) was at Brown. After dating for 6 years, we got married (finally!) in 2004.\nMack is originally from Kansas City, KS. He received his BS, MS, and PhD in Computer Science from Rice. He teaches in the Computer Science department. He has a borderline unhealthy obsession with Boba tea. He is learning to be less competitive when playing games like basketball and monopoly. He is a proud fan of the Kansas City Chiefs since they just won the Super Bowl and he insists that KC has the best BBQ.\nJamil is a native Houstonian. She received her BA in Sociology from Rice, an MD from Baylor College of Medicine, and an MBA from Rice. She works as a Pediatrician at one of Texas Children’s Hospital’s outpatient clinics. She also enjoys real estate on the side. She loves learning which has proven to be an expensive hobby. She also likes to garden. Due to the extremely low yield, it surprisingly has become an expensive hobby as well.\nWe also have 3 boys. Kaleab is 8. He likes soccer, break dancing, and building random weapons using empty cereal boxes, duct tape, and rubber bands. Kaleab is also an expert at changing the topic to something that he is interested in. You have been warned. Liam is 3. He is super strong for his age. He loves dance time, doing flips, and eating Cheetos while playing board games at The Teahouse. Elijah is 2. However, we still call him “baby”. He likes to give his mom a hug, turn towards Mack, and give him a smirk that says, “I’m the favorite now”. The whole Joyner family is super excited about O-week and getting a chance to meet you.",

    "name": "College Coordinator",
    "bio": "Hi Duncaroos! I’m Ms. Woods, the College Coordinator for Duncan. I enjoy meeting people, and I have a listening ear and a willing heart. One of the things I look forward to is developing a lasting relationship with all of the students who pass through Duncan College. I have worked at Rice for ten years. Prior to Rice, I had the privilege of working with students, young people, and professional educators. My desire is that each of you pursue your dreams, both academically and socially. There is no limit to one’s personal success, as long as you are true to yourself and respectful of others. Believe in yourself and take the time to learn from others. With each day that passes there is an opportunity to gain wisdom from someone or something. I am a proud mother of two and proud grandmother of three. Welcome to the Duncan Family!!!",
