In 2007, they \n                        donated $30 million to establishing new residential colleges to expand the student body while maintaining Rice's uniqueness. \n                        Their passion for environmental sustainability drove Duncan College to be designed as Rice’s “green” college - we are one \n                        of the first buildings in Houston to receive Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Gold Certification.</p>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n        <section class=\"section section-lg pt-lg-0\">\n            <div class=\"container justify-content-center text-center\">\n                <div class=\"row justify-content-center\">\n                    <tabs fill class=\"flex-column flex-md-row\">\n                        <tab-pane>\n                            <span slot=\"title\">\n                                Green Additions\n                            </span>\n                            <div class=\"row justify-content-center mt-4\">\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-lg-3 mx-2\" v-for=\"(prop, index) in green\" :key=\"index\">\n                                    <TextCard :text=\"prop\" />\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </tab-pane>\n                        <tab-pane>\n                            <span slot=\"title\">\n                                Common Areas\n                            </span>\n                            <div class=\"row justify-content-center mt-4\">\n                                <div class=\"col-sm-12 col-lg-3 mx-2\" v-for=\"area in areas\" :key=\"area.name\">\n                                    <ImageCard :image=\"area.image\" :name=\"area.name\" />\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </tab-pane>\n                    </tabs>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </section>\n    </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nimport Tabs from '../components/Tabs/Tabs';\nimport TabPane from '../components/Tabs/TabPane';\n\nimport TextCard from './components/Cards/TextCard';\nimport ImageCard from './components/Cards/ImageCard';\n\nimport areas from '../data/areas.data';\nimport green from '../data/green.data';\n\nexport default {\n    components: { Tabs, TabPane, TextCard, ImageCard },\n    data() {\n        return {\n            areas: [],\n            green: []\n        }\n    },\n    created() {\n        this.areas = areas\n        this.green = green\n    }\n}\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n.splash {\n    background-image: url(\"../../public/img/tank.jpeg\");\n    background-size: cover;\n    background-repeat: no-repeat;\n    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 45rem rgba(0,0,0,.6);\n}\n</style>\n","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./About.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\";

[Fun fact: O-Week brought us together!] After growing up in Dallas (yes, Cowboys fan), Winston majored in biochemistry and flag football (but also rowed crew, played in a jazz band, and did international service trips). Eden has no hometown (having lived in TX, SC, NC, CA, GA, TX, VA, and TX again) but majored in psychology (and joined half of the organizations on campus). Winston now puts his medical and public health degrees to good use as a family doctor and as the Chair of Health Systems and Population Health Sciences at UH. Eden is a professor of industrial-organizational psychology at Rice, studying and teaching about the ways that diversity and inclusion can be strengthened in the workplace.

I was a Duncaroo myself as a Rice undergraduate (Class of 2011), but this is my first year as an RA, so we’ll be learning all the ins and outs of Duncan together. As an undergrad, I majored in English and Religious Studies (ahem, after switching majors three times, but trying out different classes and interests is what college is all about!). I work over in alumni relations where I host a podcast called “Beyond the Hedges,” which features Rice’s amazing professors talking about the research they’re doing, so I can definitely let you know the most interesting professors around campus (pro tip: it’s most of them). While working with professors is such a highlight, I have to admit that the best part of my job is having access to a golf cart, so don’t be surprised if you hear me shouting your name when I’m cruising around campus between classes – I might even give you a lift if we’re headed in the same direction! When I’m not in the alumni office, I’m usually relaxing by cooking, watching TV, and checking in on all the dogs I follow on Instagram – hopefully I’ll have a pup of my own by the time you arrive. The only other thing you need to know about me is that I’m a Dolly Parton superfan, which is something that you would’ve probably learned about me pretty quickly even if I hadn’t told you.

Before moving to Houston, we actually attended the same high school in Connecticut. We even went to prom together, and have awkward photos together to prove it. Allison attended Emerson College, went on to teach for Teach for America, and then earned her Masters from Harvard in Education. Ian attended Tufts University and received his MFA from the Creative Writing Program at the University of Houston. Ian currently teaches creative writing and podcasting in the English department at Rice and Allison is a literacy content creator at Khan Academy. When we’re not at work, we love to play basketball and go fishing (Ian), do yoga and cook (Allison), eat way too much (both of us), travel, go to the beach, and hang out with our adventurous 4-year-old, Owen. Owen loves riding his bike, splashing in the Dunctank, and playing not-so-frozen freeze tag in the quad. We live on the third floor and are looking forward to hosting many study breaks for you in the coming years.\",\n    \"image\": \"/img/people/squad/thirdfloor.png\",\n    \"members\": [\"Allison|allisonleedie@gmail.com\", \"Ian|ianschimmel@gmail.com\", \"Owen\"]\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"RFAs\",\n    \"bio\": \"We are Mack and Jamil, your Resident Faculty Associates. We are excited to begin our 2nd year as RFAs at Duncan. Our love story started freshman year at Rice. Mack was at Sid and Jamil was at Jones. Our first dance together was at Lovett and our first kiss (ewww) was at Brown. After dating for 6 years, we got married (finally!) in 2004.\\nMack is originally from Kansas City, KS. He received his BS, MS, and PhD in Computer Science from Rice. He teaches in the Computer Science department. He has a borderline unhealthy obsession with Boba tea. He is learning to be less competitive when playing games like basketball and monopoly. He is a proud fan of the Kansas City Chiefs since they just won the Super Bowl and he insists that KC has the best BBQ.\\nJamil is a native Houstonian. She received her BA in Sociology from Rice, an MD from Baylor College of Medicine, and an MBA from Rice. She works as a Pediatrician at one of Texas Children’s Hospital’s outpatient clinics. She also enjoys real estate on the side. She loves learning which has proven to be an expensive hobby. She also likes to garden. Due to the extremely low yield, it surprisingly has become an expensive hobby as well.\\nWe also have 3 boys. Kaleab is 8. He likes soccer, break dancing, and building random weapons using empty cereal boxes, duct tape, and rubber bands. Kaleab is also an expert at changing the topic to something that he is interested in. You have been warned. Liam is 3. He is super strong for his age. He loves dance time, doing flips, and eating Cheetos while playing board games at The Teahouse. Elijah is 2. However, we still call him “baby”. He likes to give his mom a hug, turn towards Mack, and give him a smirk that says, “I’m the favorite now”. The whole Joyner family is super excited about O-week and getting a chance to meet you.\",\n    \"image\": \"/img/people/squad/rfas.PNG\",\n    \"members\": [\"Mack|mjoyner@rice.edu\", \"Jamil|jap11@rice.edu\", \"Kaleab\", \"Liam\", \"Elijah\"]\n  },\n  {\n    \"name\": \"College Coordinator\",\n    \"bio\": \"Hello new and returning Duncaroos! My name is Kate Sundie and I am so excited to be joining the Duncan family this fall as your new college coordinator. I was born in Phoenix, AZ, but moved around a lot as a child and young adult (Phoenix -> Houston -> San Antonio -> Blacksburg, Virginia -> Phoenix -> Blacksburg -> Houston). I attended Arizona State and then Radford University, where I got my degree in communications and history. I moved back to Houston in the Summer of 2020 with my partner Will and my dog Pepper. I’m VERY happy to share that Pepper will likely be coming to campus with me often and would very much appreciate any and all attention from students. My professional background is in marketing, communications, and event planning, so I’m looking forward to working with all of you to put on some fantastic events this year in addition to designing some cool Duncan College merch. Outside of work, I enjoy reading, cooking, hanging out with my dog, visiting museums, learning foreign languages, playing board games, and trying food at some of Houston’s many wonderful restaurants. For those of you who are new to Rice (like me), the College Coordinator does the behind-the-scenes work that keeps the college running. I’ll be the one you go to to connect with offices around campus, get mail and packages, and answer any questions about Duncan College and housing. You can also visit me in my office on the first floor of Duncan for a cup of tea or coffee, a sweet treat, and/or a chat. I can’t wait to meet you all very soon!\",\n    \"image\": \"/img/people/squad/coordinator.jpg\",\n    \"members\": [\"Kate|kes22@rice.edu\"]\n  }\n]","import mod from
